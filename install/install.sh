# agent-system 2.0 install — skeleton (migration step M2).
#
# Reads install/manifest.tsv (SPEC-2.0.md § B8: the manifest IS the machinery table) and installs
# each row by its kind. Today that means: create or verify the ledger from the manifest's one
# ledger-schema row, using its one ledger-init row, then take the first scheduled copy with its
# one ledger-backup row. Profile building (template, extension and agent links) arrives with the
# later migration steps as new kinds.
#
# Usage:   bash install/install.sh
# Env:     AGENT_SYSTEM_LEDGER_DB   ledger file (default: $HOME/.agent-system-2/ledger.db)
# Exit:    0 installed · 1 other failure · 2 manifest check failed (nothing written)
#          3 ledger path refused as synced or network folder (nothing written)
#
# Order matters: every check runs before anything is written, so a failed install leaves the
# machine as it found it. Safe to re-run: an existing ledger at the current schema is untouched.
